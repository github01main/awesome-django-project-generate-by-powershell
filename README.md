## Usage

Install `cookiecutter` and generate a project:

```python
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:jacebrowning/template-python -f
```

Cookiecutter will ask you for some basic info (your name, project name, python package name, etc.) and generate a base Python project for you.
Once created, run the code formatter to updates files based on your chosen names:

```python
$ cd <github_repo>
$ make format
```

Finally, commit all files generated by this template.

## Updates

Run the update tool, which is generated inside each project:

```python
$ bin/update
```
